## What is a "River of News" or "Newsriver"?

Here's what Dave wrote about this:

> _River of News_ is a kind of RSS aggregator.
> Items are presented in reverse-chronologic order.
> Each item has a headline, short description, a link to the story, links to the website and feed it came from, a link to its enclosure if it has one, when it was published, when it appeared in the river.


todo:

* get rid of `davereader` dependency
* swipe left and right should switch feeds
* make header nav float smartly with the content (but only appear on scroll-up)
